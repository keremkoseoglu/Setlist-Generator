I got chills.
They're multiplyin'.
And I'm losin' control.
'Cause the power
You're suplyin',
It's electrifyin'!

You better shape up,
'Cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you.
You better shape up;
You better understand
To my heart I must be true.

Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do.

You're the one that I want.
You, oo, oo, honey.
The one that I want.
You, oo, oo, honey.
The one that I want
You, oo, oo
Are what I need.
Oh, yes indeed.

If you're filled
With affection
You're too shy to convey,
Meditate in my direction.
Feel your way.

I better shape up,
'Cause you need a man
Who can keep you satisfied.
I better shape up
If I'm gonna prove
That your faith is justified.
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure down deep inside.

You're the one that I want.
You, oo, oo, honey.
The one that I want.
You, oo, oo, honey.
The one that I want
You, oo, oo
Are what I need.
Oh, yes indeed

You're the one that I want.
You, oo, oo, honey.
The one that I want.
You, oo, oo, honey.
The one that I want
You, oo, oo
Are what I need.
Oh, yes indeed

You're the one that I want.
You, oo, oo, honey.
The one that I want.
You, oo, oo, honey.
The one that I want
You, oo, oo
Are what I need.
Oh, yes indeed
