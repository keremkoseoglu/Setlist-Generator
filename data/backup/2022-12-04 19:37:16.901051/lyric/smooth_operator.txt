    - amour tes la bir snarky puppy parçası
    - parça ismi "aşk neredesin?" demek
    - Snarky puppy’nin nadir sambalarından biri
    - normalde dev bir orkestra çalıyor, biz daha minimal bir yorumla çaldık
    - sıradaki parça klasiklerden biri; biz bunu da biraz farklı bir yorumla çalacağız

Smooth Operator - reminor

Sax

Diamond life, lover boy
We move in space with, minimum waste, and maximum joy
City lights, and business nights
When you require street, car desire, for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment, is left to, chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale

Bass gecis

Sax solo

Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the, chase

A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
