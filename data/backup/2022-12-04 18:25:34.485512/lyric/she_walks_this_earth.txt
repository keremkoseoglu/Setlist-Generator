    - Sıradaki parça yine Sting'in de yorumladığı Brezilya parçalarından biri
    - Orijinali "Soberana Rosa", biz "She Walks This Earth" halini çalacağız
    - Parçanın sonuna da bir sürpriz sakladık

She walks this earth - Re

She's a soulful, flower in the garden
She's bobbin' in the sunlight, and flirtin' with her eye's
The way she walks by, I see a wave of color
Moving like an angel, trailin' butterflies

Give me water, give me inspiration
I want to speak now, but I can't find a word
So unforgiving, is my infatu-ation
  Now that I know, she walks upon the earth
She walks this earth

Melodi 4

I am restless, burin' with desire
And every other heartbeat, I beat just for her
I see her smilin', full as my emotion
This is no illusion, but how can I be heard?

Give me water, give me inspiration
I want to speak now, but I can't find a word
So unforgiving, is this infatuation
Now that I know, she walks upon the earth
She walks this earth
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Solo

She's a soulful, flower in the garden
She's bobbin' in the sunlight, and flirtin' with her eye's
The way she walks by, I see a wave of color
Moving like an angel, trailin' butterflies

Give me water, give me inspiration
I need to hold her, like no one else before
So unforgiving, is my infatuation
Now that I know, she walks upon the earth
She walks this earth
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
