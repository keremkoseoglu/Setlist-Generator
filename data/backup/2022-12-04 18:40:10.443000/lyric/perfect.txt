I don't want half hearted love affairs
I need someone who really cares.
Life is too short to play silly games
I've promised myself I won't do that again.
It's got to be perfect
It's got to be worth it
Yeah.
Too many people take second best
Well I won't take anything less
It's got to be
Yeah
Perfect.
Young hearts are foolish
They make such mistakes
They're much too eager to give their love away.
Well
I have been foolish too many times
Now I'm determined I'm gonna get it right.
It's got to be perfect...
Young hearts are foolish
They make such mistakes
It's got to be perfect...
It's got to be
Yeah
Worth it
It's got to be perfect.
