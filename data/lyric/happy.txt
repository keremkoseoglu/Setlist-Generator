Happy - Faminor


It might seem crazy, what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a, a hot air balloon, that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby, by the way


Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof  
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Clap along if you feel like, that's what you wanna do

Here come some bad news, where this and that
Well, give me all you got, and baby don't hold back
Well, I should probably warn you, I'll be just fine
No offense to you, don't waste your time
Here's why

Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof  
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Clap along if you feel like, that's what you wanna do

Sax solo - tam tur

Adlib (My level's too high, to bring me down) - tam 4 tur

Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof  
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Clap along if you feel like, that's what you wanna do
