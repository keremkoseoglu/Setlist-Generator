    - sıradaki parçanın orijinali Jobim'e ait, ismi "Insensatez"
    - ancak Sting de seslendirdiği için çok kişi tarafından tanınıyor
    - biz parçayı hızlı bir sambaya çevirdik, bakalım nasıl olmuş?

How insensitive - Laminor

How insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that he loved me

How unmoved, and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so, sincerely

Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence

What was I to say
What can you say, when a love affair, is over

Solo 

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look

Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look

Why she must have asked
Did I just stare, in icy silence

What was I to do
What can one do, when a love affair is over
Overrr
