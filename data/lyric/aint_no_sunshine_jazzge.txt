Aint no sunshine - Miminor

Solo

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when, she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
she's always gone too long, anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone?
Wonder if she's gone to stay?
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone?
this house just ain't no home, anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
Hey I ought to, leave the young, thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone, anytime she goes away

Solo

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
this house just ain't no home, anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home, anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
