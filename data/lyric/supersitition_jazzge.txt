Supersitition - Faminor

Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall?
Very superstitious?
Ladders bout' to fall?
Thirteen month old baby?
Broke the lookin' glass?
Seven years of bad luck?
Good things in the past

When you believe in things?
That You don't understand?
You gonna suffer ahhhh?
Superstition ainï¿½t the way

Hey hey hey

Very superstitious?
Shoes on table top?
Very superstitious
We were all mixed up?
Walking over broomsticks?
Lying on the floor?
Loan me your umbrella?
Later after dark

When you believe in things?
That You don't understand?
You gonna suffer ahhhh?
Superstition ain't the way
